# rust-oxide-umod

*Because their site has flood protection and they need a plugin repo on github for speed*
## notes
* I am in the middle of this project
* I am not a programmer or know anything about  any computer languages
* This is an attempt at randomly pressing keys and trying to get something to work
* None of these files are finished or properly working
* Don't expect anything here to function
* This is here only so I can work on multiple machines without copying files back and forth
* I noticed that some authors modify plugins without updating version info :(
